// delegatecall is tricky to use and wrong usage or incorrect understanding can lead to devastating results.

// You must keep 2 things in mind when using delegatecall

// 1_delegatecall preserves context (storage, caller, etc...)
// 2_storage layout must be the same for the contract calling delegatecall and the contract getting called

This is a more sophisticated version of the previous exploit.

1. Alice deploys Lib and HackMe with the address of Lib
2. Eve deploys Attack with the address of HackMe
3. Eve calls Attack.attack()
4. Attack is now the owner of HackMe

What happened?
Notice that the state variables are not defined in the same manner in Lib
and HackMe. This means that calling Lib.doSomething() will change the first
state variable inside HackMe, which happens to be the address of lib.

Inside attack(), the first call to doSomething() changes the address of lib
store in HackMe. Address of lib is now set to Attack.
The second call to doSomething() calls Attack.doSomething() and here we
change the owner.

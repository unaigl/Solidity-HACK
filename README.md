# Solidity-HACK
 How to prevent code hack in solidity

The purpose of this repository is to show how a solidity smart contract can be hack, to learn about the risks involved writing solidity code.
This video does encourage you to protect your code.

I would like to thank Tasuku Nakamura for his master classes.
